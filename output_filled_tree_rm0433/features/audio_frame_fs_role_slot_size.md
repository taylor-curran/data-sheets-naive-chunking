**AI Reasoning**: The content chunk discusses the configuration of audio frames, specifically focusing on the FS role and slot size in the SAI (Serial Audio Interface). This falls under the 'features' category as it describes specific functionalities and configurations of the STM32 microcontroller's audio interface. The directory path is kept simple with 'features' to ensure easy findability, and the filename captures the essence of the figures discussed.
