**AI Reasoning**: The content discusses specific configurations of ADC conversion modes, particularly focusing on how regular hardware conversions are interrupted by injected conversions. This fits well under 'features' as it describes specific operational characteristics of the microcontroller's ADC feature. The filename captures the essence of the content by highlighting the key terms and configurations discussed.
