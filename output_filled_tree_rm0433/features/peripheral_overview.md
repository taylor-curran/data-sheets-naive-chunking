**AI Reasoning**: The content chunk lists various peripherals (EXTI, TIM, CRC, etc.) and their configurations, which fits under a general overview of features. A shallow directory structure with a 'features' category is appropriate for easy access, and the filename captures the essence of the content as an overview of peripherals.
