**AI Reasoning**: The content focuses on low-power modes and the state of GPIO pins, which are features of the microcontroller. Grouping these tables under 'features' makes it easy to locate information related to the operational characteristics of the device. The filename captures the essence of both tables discussed in the chunk.
