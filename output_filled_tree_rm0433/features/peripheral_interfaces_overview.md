**AI Reasoning**: The content chunk lists various peripheral interfaces and modules (e.g., SYSCFG, CRYP, FDCAN, etc.) available in the STM32H7 series microcontrollers. This fits well under a 'features' category as it highlights the capabilities and interfaces provided by the hardware. The filename 'peripheral_interfaces_overview.md' captures the essence of the content, making it easily discoverable for users looking for information on the available peripherals.
