**AI Reasoning**: The content chunk lists various peripheral interfaces (DLYB, RTC, ADC, I2C, DAC, USART/UART, VREFBUF) and mentions embedded flash memory. This suggests an overview of the features related to peripheral interfaces and memory. Placing it under 'features' provides a broad category that is easy to locate, and the filename captures the essence of the content by highlighting the focus on peripheral interfaces.
