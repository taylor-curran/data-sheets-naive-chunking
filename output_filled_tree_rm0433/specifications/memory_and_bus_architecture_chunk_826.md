**AI Reasoning**: The content chunk primarily discusses various types of memory (e.g., SRAM, Flash) and bus architecture (e.g., AHB, AXI) in the STM32H7 series. This fits well under 'specifications' as it details the technical architecture and layout of the microcontroller's memory and bus systems. The filename 'memory_and_bus_architecture.md' succinctly captures the essence of the content.
