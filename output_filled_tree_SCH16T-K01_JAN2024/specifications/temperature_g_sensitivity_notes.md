axes) K)
G-sensitivity L) For DC gravity input 0.006 (°/s)/(m/s2)
Notes:
• Specified Min/Max values contain ±3 sigma variation limits of original test population. Typical values are validation population
mean (unless otherwise specified). Min/Max and typical values are not guaranteed, values represent validation population
characteristics.
• Specification is valid after 24 hours from reflow.
• Each system design including SCH16T series component must be evaluated by the customer in advance to guarantee proper
functionality during operation.
