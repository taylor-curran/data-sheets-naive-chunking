Table 5 Gyroscope parameter definitions
Symbol Description
Measurement range is tied to electrical headroom and is selectable from predefined options presented in 7.4.2.
A)
Changing electrical headroom affects only signal path sensitivity (up to 4*nominal sensitivity).
B) Initial offset at Murata production measurement after calibration
Offset drift over temperature is determined by ((maximum offset value over temperature) - (minimum offset value
C)
over temperature)) / 2 in condition of one temperature sweep in specified temperature range.
Estimated from offset drift during 1000 hours of high temperature operating life (HTOL) test at 125 °C and maximum
D)
supply voltages.
Default sensitivity used in factory calibration. With this default sensitivity, signal has a typical electrical headroom of
E)
±327.5 °/s.
