**AI Reasoning**: The content describes specific performance characteristics of a gyroscope, such as offset drift, RMS noise, and Allan variance. These are detailed specifications relevant to the gyroscope's performance, making 'specifications' the most appropriate category. The filename captures the essence of the content by focusing on the gyroscope's performance characteristics.
