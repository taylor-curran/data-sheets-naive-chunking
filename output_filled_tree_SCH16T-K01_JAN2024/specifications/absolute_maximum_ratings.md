3.3 Absolute maximum ratings
Murata guarantees sensor operation without parameter related damage or functional deviation within
these maximum ratings. However, output values may deviate from specification if parameter values are
accelerometer. All voltages are related to the potential at GND.

**AI Reasoning**: The content discusses the limits within which the sensor can operate without damage, which falls under specifications. This is a common section in datasheets detailing operational boundaries, making it a suitable fit for the 'specifications' category.
