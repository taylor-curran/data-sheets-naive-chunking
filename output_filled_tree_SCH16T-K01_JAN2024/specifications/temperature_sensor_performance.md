3.8 Temperature sensor
Table 8 Temperature sensor performance specification
Parameter Min Nom Max Unit
Measurement range -50 135 °C
Temperature signal sensitivity 100 LSB/°C
Total Error -15 15 °C
Linearity -1 1 °C
Temperature is converted to °C with following equation:
Temperature [°C] = TEMP / 100, where TEMP is temperature sensor output register content in 2’s
complement format.
SCH16T Filter characteristics are presented in table below.
