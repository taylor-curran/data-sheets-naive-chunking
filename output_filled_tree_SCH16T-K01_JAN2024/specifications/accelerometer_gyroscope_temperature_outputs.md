**AI Reasoning**: The content chunk provides specific details about the outputs of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and a temperature sensor, including their configuration and register addresses. This fits well under 'specifications' as it describes the technical output characteristics of these components. The filename captures the essence of the content by mentioning the key components discussed.
