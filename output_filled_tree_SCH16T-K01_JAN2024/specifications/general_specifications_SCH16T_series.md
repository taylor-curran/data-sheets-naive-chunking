1) Decimation ratio X is selectable from the following options: 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32
2) After voltage supplies are within specification
Murata guarantees sensor operation without parameter related damage or functional deviation within
these maximum ratings. However, output values may deviate from specification if parameter values are
