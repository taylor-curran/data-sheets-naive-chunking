6.5.1 SPI48BF CRC
SPI48BF uses 8-bit CRC (CRC8). CRC is calculated from MSB towards LSB for 40 MSB bits of the
frame, i.e., from bit 47 to 8. Generator polynomial is b100101111 (POLY:9) and calculation is initialized
to b11111111. Final CRC is the direct value of the calculation.
Parameter Value
Name CRC-8

**AI Reasoning**: The content discusses the CRC method used in the SPI48BF, which is a technical specification detail. Placing it under 'specifications' keeps it easily accessible for those looking for technical details about the hardware. The filename captures the essence of the content by highlighting the CRC and the specific protocol (SPI48BF) it applies to.
