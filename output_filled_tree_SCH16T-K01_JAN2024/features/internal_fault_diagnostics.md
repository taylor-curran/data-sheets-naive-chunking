5.2 Internal fault diagnostics
During the startup sequence, the sensor performs a series of internal tests that will set various error
flags in the sensor status registers. To clear them it is necessary to read the status registers after the
start-up sequence is complete. When reading the status registers, the user must consider that the state
of status flags is not defined during LPM (Low Power Mode) and the 250 ms wait state after
EN_SENSOR.
