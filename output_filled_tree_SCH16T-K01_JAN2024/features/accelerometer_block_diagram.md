Figure 7 SCH16T Component block diagram
4.2 Accelerometer
The acceleration sensing element consists of three acceleration-sensitive masses. Acceleration causes
a capacitance change that is converted into a voltage change in the signal conditioning ASIC.
The angular rate sensing element consists of moving masses that are intentionally exited to in-plane
drive motion. Rotation in a sensitive direction causes in-plane (Z) or out-of-plane (XY) movement that

**AI Reasoning**: The content describes the components and functionality of the accelerometer and angular rate sensing elements, which are features of the SCH16T device. Placing it under 'features' makes it easily discoverable for those looking for functional descriptions. The filename captures the essence of the content by highlighting the block diagram and accelerometer focus.
