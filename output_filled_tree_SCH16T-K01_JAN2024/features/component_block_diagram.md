4.1 Component block diagram
The SCH16T sensor consists of independent acceleration and angular rate sensing elements, and an
Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) used to sense and control those elements. The angular
rate and acceleration sensing elements are manufactured using Murata's proprietary High Aspect Ratio
(HAR) 3D-MEMS process, which enables making robust, extremely stable, and low noise capacitive
sensors.
