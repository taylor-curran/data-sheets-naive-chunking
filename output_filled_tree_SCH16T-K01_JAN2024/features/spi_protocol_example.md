Figure 12 SPI protocol example
Product SPI block implements two different SPI protocol types. Both protocol types can be used during
operation by defining the SPI frame bit length.
• SafeSPI2 32-bit frame, SPI32BF.
• SafeSPI2 48-bit frame, SPI48BF.
can be seen in table below. For Safe SPI standard, please refer to www.SafeSPI.org
