5.4.1, worst case sampling jitter can be up to 85 Âµs with decimation factor of 1. When decimation factor
is increased, the worst-case sampling jitter is increased accordingly.
In case jitter minimization is critical in application, user should use the data ready output pin
(DRY_SYNC). When all sensor output channels have been updated, the data ready triggers a rising
edge to indicate that the samples were generated. This rising edge can be used as a direct interrupt to
start sensor read operation, or the host can take note of the data ready signal and ensure that the data
is read in a burst before the next expected sensor internal update. This way the system can ensure that
no samples are missed, and no samples are being read twice.

**AI Reasoning**: The content discusses the behavior of sampling jitter and the use of the data ready output pin (DRY_SYNC) to manage it. This is a feature of the sensor, as it describes how to handle specific operational characteristics. Placing it under 'features' makes it easily discoverable for users looking for operational details and functionalities.
