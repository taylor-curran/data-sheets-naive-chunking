Overview
The SCH16T is a combined high-performance 3-axis angular rate and 3-axis accelerometer. The angular
rate and accelerometer sensor elements are based on Murata's proven capacitive 3D-MEMS technology.
Signal processing is done by a single mixed-signal ASIC that provides angular rate and acceleration via a
flexible SafeSPI v2.0 compliant digital interface. Sensor elements and ASIC are packaged to pre-molded
SOIC 24-pin plastic housing that guarantees reliable operation over the product's lifetime.
The SCH16T is designed, manufactured, and tested for high stability, reliability, and quality requirements.
The component has extremely stable output over temperature, humidity, and vibration. The component has
ELV directives.
