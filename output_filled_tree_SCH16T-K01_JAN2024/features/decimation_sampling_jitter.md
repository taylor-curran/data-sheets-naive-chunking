Drawback of decimation is that sampling jitter is increased with the same ratio as the decimation factor.
With nominal primary frequency and decimation ratio of 16, the sampling jitter will be up to 85 Âµs x 16 =
the user can combine decimation with the data ready function. Data ready is explained in chapter 5.4.4.

**AI Reasoning**: The content discusses the concept of decimation and its effect on sampling jitter, which is a feature-related topic. It provides specific details about decimation ratios and their impact, making 'features' the most appropriate category. The filename captures the essence of the content, focusing on decimation and sampling jitter.
