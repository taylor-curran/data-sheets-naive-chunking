5.4 Solutions for asynchronous clock domains
Multiple features are implemented to improve synchronization between the product's internal clock and
application system clock. While most systems can most likely cope with conventional continuous polling
of SPI peripheral, accurate time-domain synchronization can be essential in certain high-performance
