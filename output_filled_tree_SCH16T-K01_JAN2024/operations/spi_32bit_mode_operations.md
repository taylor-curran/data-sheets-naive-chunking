6.6 Operations
This chapter describes some common SPI operations.
6.6.1 32-bit mode operations
The SPI binary frame is constructed as follows:
(TA9 TA8 TA[7:0] RW 0 FrTyp DATA[15:0] CRC3)
Command Register SPI Binary Frame SPI Hex frame
EN_SENSOR CTRL_MODE 0 0 00110101 1 0 0 0000000000000001 010 0x0D60000A

**AI Reasoning**: The content describes specific operations related to SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) in 32-bit mode, including the structure of the binary frame. This fits well under a general 'operations' category, which can encompass various operational modes and procedures. The filename captures the essence of the content by highlighting the SPI 32-bit mode operations, making it easily discoverable.
