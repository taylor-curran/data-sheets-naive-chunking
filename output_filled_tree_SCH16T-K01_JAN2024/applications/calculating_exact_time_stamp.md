5.4.7 Calculating exact time stamp
The data counter value can be combined with the frequency counter value to calculate the exact time
stamp of a sample when the MCU clock of the host system is used as reference. This combination is
recommended if integration operations are performed to sensor data and timing uncertainty or data jitter
of the interpolated data do not fulfill system accuracy requirements.
